### [Design 1](images/design1.png):
- Design is simple and easy to understand
- Call of action is straightfoward and easy to find
- Our special dishes should have larger images and less of descriptions
- The book a table options are easy to look for

### [Design 2](images/design2.jpg):
- Design emphazies the ruler archetype and our wish to have an elegant site
- Call of action is not straightfoward
- Reservations should be placed right on the main image
- Should make main image a bit transparent and add the reservation box there as well

### Overall Thoughts
- Design 1 was effortless and simple to understand. Design 2 emphazies the intended archetype we have in mind. Some small adjustments should be made to make Design 2 have a call to action that stands out. Design 2 is the choicen design for our site.
