### Design 1:
- Design is simple and easy to understand
- Call of action is straightfoward and easy to find
- Our special dishes should have larger images and less of descriptions
- The book a table options are easy to look for

### Design 2:
- Design emphazies the ruler archetype and our wish to have an elegant site
- Call of action is not straightfoward
- Reservations should be placed right on the main image
- Should make main image a bit transparent and add the reservation box there as well
